# React-UI-Components

- This repository is designed to be your first exposure into the world of ReactJS. You will be 2 days to complete the 2 assignments in this repository. Day 1 is all about implementing a Social Card in ReactJS. We've given you the file structure and have gone ahead and added all the files you'll need to be set up for success for each project.

## Initializing the application.

- This project was bootstrapped using `create-react-app` (CRA). **You will not need to install CRA in order to make this project work**

## Instructions

- Use the design files to build out your User Interfaces.
- All components can be built out using the provided html files found in their respective directories.
- Each file has been set up to work within a `react.js` environment. Pay attention to the notes found within each project.
- All styles can be achieved within the provided `<style />` tag. Feel free to include a `cdn` for bootstrap v.4 if you'd like. Don't forget about `className` vs `class`!!
- Once you and your partner are finished please submit a pull-request to your Project Manager.
- Work on the required features first and then move on. You can come back to Project 1 and start with the `Stretch Problem` once you're done with the requirements for Project 2.

## _Day I - Social Card_

- Start with the `Social Card` `Project-1.png` file and use the `index.html` file to build out all the components you need to complete the project to the specification.

- The idea here is to break this `.png` file down into components. Think of each singular piece as a DOM Element and how you will be separating each as it's own `functional component`.
- For the react Banner part of the social card you can feel free to use this `https://ibin.co/3wnC6SgIOJud.png` in an src attribute on an `img` tag. Or find one on the web and use that.
- For the Lambda Avatar feel free to use `https://ibin.co/3whrpKSBbZ81.png` or any lambda logo you may find on the web.
- **Stretch Problem 1** Include the icons. This is not a trivial task.
- **Stretch Problem 2** After you build out a card, put together some mock data, (an array of objects) and create a grid view of multiple cards.`

## _Day II - React Calculator_

- Now that you've been building out your `Social Card` use the `Project-2.png` file and the`index.html` file to build out all the components you need to build out a calculator that looks much like the one in the png.

- **Stretch Problem 1** After you build out the calculator, make all of the buttons work. You have a lot of knowledge already to be able to achieve this. However feel free to research into it as much as you need.
