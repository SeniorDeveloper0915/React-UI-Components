# React-UI-Components

* This repository is built for you to be able to gain a fundamental understanding of React Functional Components. There are a few design `.png` files that you'll find inside of the `assets` directory that your tasked to build out into pieces of UI using ReactJS.

## Instructions

* Use the design files to build out your User Interfaces.
* All components can be built out using the provided codepens that we have set up for you.

## _Project 1 - Social Card_

* Start with the `Social Card` `Project-1.png` file and use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/NYYWdx) to build out all the components you need to complete the project to the specification.

* The idea here is to break this `.png` file down into components. Think of each singular piece as a DOM Element and how you will be separating each as it's own `functional component`.
* For the react Banner part of the social card you can feel free to use this `https://ibin.co/3whqv86HCUo0.png` in an src attribute on an `img` tag. Or find one on the web and use that.
* For the Lambda Avatar feel free to use `https://ibin.co/3whrpKSBbZ81.png` or any lambda logo you may find on the web.
* **Stretch Problem 1** Include the icons. This is not a trivial task.
* **Stretch Problem 2** After you build out a card, put together some mock data, and create a grid view of multiple cards.`

## _Project 2 - React Calculator_

* Now that you've been building out your `Social Card` use the `Project-2.png` file and [this codepen](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/xWWMzg) to build out all the components you need to build out a calculator that looks much like the one in the png.

* **Stretch Problem 1** After you build out the calculator, put together make all of the buttons work. You have a lot of knowledge already to be able to achieve this. However feel free to research into it as much as you need.`
