# React-UI-Components

* This repository is built for you to be able to gain a fundamental understanding of React Functional Components. There are a few design `.png` files that you'll find inside of the `assets` directory that your tasked to build out into pieces of UI using ReactJS.

## Instructions

* Use the design files to build out your User Interfaces.
* _Project 1 - Social Card_ Start with the `Social Card` `.png` file and use [this codepen](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/NYYWdx) to build out all the components you need to complete the project to the specification.
* Use the lambda Logo provided as the image for the Avatar Thumbnail

  * The idea here is to break this `.png` file down into components. Think of each singular piece DOM and how you will be separating each as it's own component.
  * **Stretch Problem** After you build out a card, put together some mock data, and create a grid view of multiple cards.

* _Project 1 - Social Card_ Start with the `Social Card` `.png` file and use [this codepen]() to build out all the components you need to complete the project to the specification.
